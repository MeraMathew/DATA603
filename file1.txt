closed the door on the empty yard and then steered
Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the
lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
“Y
ou’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and
down. “Both of you look as though you’ve had
Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’
s grown
four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are
you hungry
, Harry?”
“Y
eah, I am,” said Harry
, suddenly realizing just how
hungry he was.
“Sit down, dear
, I’ll knock something up.”

As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed
face jumped onto his knees and settled there,
purring.
“So Hermione’
s here?” he asked happily as he tickled
Crookshanks behind the ears.
“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday
,” said
Mrs. W
easley
, rapping a lar
ge iron pot with her wand.
It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began
to bubble at once. “Everyone’
s in bed, of course, we
didn’
t expect you for hours. Here you are —”
She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air
, flew
toward Harry
, and tipped over; Mrs. W
easley slid a
bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the
stream of thick, steaming onion soup.

“Bread, dear?”
“Thanks, Mrs. W
easley
.”
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of
bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as
www.ztcprep.com
the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back
onto the stove, Mrs. W
easley sat down opposite him.
“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?”
Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he
could not speak.
“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. W
easley
. “He
was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same
time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?”
His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and
gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.
“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. W
easley
, nodding
wisely
. “Of course he can be charming when he wants
to be, but Arthur
’
s never liked him much. The
Ministry’
s littered with Slughorn’
s old favorites, he
was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had
much time for Arthur — didn’
t seem to think he was
enough of a highflier
. W
ell, that just shows you, even
Slughorn makes mistakes. I don’
t know whether
Ron’
s told you in any of his letters — it’
s only just
happened — but Arthur
’
s been promoted!”
www.ztcprep.com
It could not have been clearer that Mrs. W
easley had
been bursting to say this.
Harry swallowed a lar
ge amount of very hot soup and
thought he could feel his throat blistering. “That’
s
great!” he gasped.

“Y
ou are sweet,” beamed Mrs. W
easley
, possibly
taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news.
“Y
es, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new of
fices
in response to the present situation, and Arthur
’
s
heading the Of
fice for the Detection and Confiscation
of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.
It’
s a big job, he’
s got ten people reporting to him
now!”
“What exactly — ?”
“W
ell, you see, in all the panic about Y
ou-Know-Who,
odd things have been cropping up for sale
everywhere, things that are supposed to guard
against Y
ou-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. Y
ou
www.ztcprep.com
can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective
potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber
pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that
actually make your ears fall of
f. … W
ell, in the main
the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus
Fletcher
, who’ve never done an honest day’
s work in
their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened
everybody is, but every now and then something
really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur
confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were
almost certainly planted by a Death Eater
. So you
see, it’
s a very important job, and I tell him it’
s just
silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters
and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. W
easley
ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been
Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark
plugs.
“Is Mr
. W
easley still at work?” Harry asked.
“Y
es, he is. As a matter of fact, he’
s a tiny bit late. …
He said he’d be back around midnight. …”

She turned to look at a lar
ge clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a
pile of sheets in the washing
basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at
once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the
name of a family member
, and usually hung on the
W
easleys’ sitting room wall, though its current
position suggested that Mrs. W
easley had taken to
carrying it around the house with her
. Every single
one of its nine hands was now pointing at “mortal
peril.”
“It’
s been like that for a while now
,” said Mrs.
W
easley
, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever
since Y
ou-Know-Who came back into the open. I
suppose everybody’
s in mortal danger now
. … I don’
t
think it can be just our family … but I don’
t know
anyone else who’
s got a clock like this, so I can’
t
check. Oh!”
W
ith a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’
s
face. Mr
. W
easley’
s hand had switched to “traveling.”
www.ztcprep.com
“He’
s coming!”
And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock
on the back door
. Mrs. W
easley jumped up and
hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her
face pressed against the wood she called softly
,
“Arthur
, is that you?”
“Y
es,” came Mr
. W
easley’
s weary voice. “But I would
say that even if I were a Death Eater
, dear
. Ask the
question!”
“Oh, honestly …”
“Molly!”
“All right, all right … What is your dearest ambition?”

“T
o find out how airplanes stay up.”
Mrs. W
easley nodded and turned the doorknob, but
apparently Mr
. W
easley was holding tight to it on the
other side, because the door remained firmly shut.
“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!”
“Arthur
, really
, this is just silly
. …”
www.ztcprep.com
“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone
together?”
Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell
that Mrs. W
easley had turned bright red; he himself
felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and
hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as
he could against the bowl.
“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. W
easley
into the crack at the edge of the door
.
“Correct,” said Mr
. W
easley
. “Now you can let me in.”
Mrs. W
easley opened the door to reveal her husband,
a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-
rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling
cloak.
“I still don’
t see why we have to go through that every
time you come home,” said Mrs. W
easley
, still pink in
the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak.
“I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer
out of you before impersonating you!”
“I know
, dear
, but it’
s Ministry procedure, and I have
www.ztcprep.com
to set an example. Something smells good — onion
soup?”

Mr
. W
easley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
“Harry! W
e didn’
t expect you until morning!”
They shook hands, and Mr
. W
easley dropped into the
chair beside Harry as Mrs. W
easley set a bowl of soup
in front of him too.
“Thanks, Molly
. It’
s been a tough night. Some idiot’
s
started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them
around your neck and you’ll be able to change your
appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all
for ten Galleons!”
“And what really happens when you put them on?”
“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color
,
but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike
warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo’
s didn’
t
have enough to do already!”
“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and Geor
ge
www.ztcprep.com
would find funny
,” said Mrs. W
easley hesitantly
. “Are
you sure — ?”
“Of course I am!” said Mr
. W
easley
. “The boys
wouldn’
t do anything like that now
, not when people
are desperate for protection!”
“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?”
“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in
Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law
Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we
got there. …”
Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.

“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. W
easley at once. “I’ve got Fred and
Geor
ge’
s room all ready for you, you’ll
have it to yourself.”
“Why
, where are they?”
“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley
, sleeping in the little flat
over their joke shop as they’re so busy
,” said Mrs.
W
easley
. “I must say
, I didn’

they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business!
